## Cipher Implementation in python 3

Different types of encryption and decryption methods are coded using python. 

We tried to implement the code for programming problems given in the book `Stallings, William - Cryptography and network security principles and practice-Pearson (2017)` chapter 3.

3.23 Write a program that can encrypt and decrypt using the general Caesar cipher, also known as an additive cipher.

3.24 Write a program that can encrypt and decrypt using the affine cipher described in Problem 3.1.

3.25 Write a program that can perform a letter frequency attack on an additive cipher without human intervention. Your software should produce possible plaintexts in rough order of likelihood. It would be good if your user interface allowed the user to specify “give me the top 10 possible plaintexts.”

3.26 Write a program that can perform a letter frequency attack on any monoalphabetic substitution cipher without human intervention. Your software should produce possible plaintexts in rough order of likelihood. It would be good if your user interface allowed the user to specify “give me the top
10 possible plaintexts.”

3.27 Create software that can encrypt and decrypt using a 2 * 2 Hill cipher.
